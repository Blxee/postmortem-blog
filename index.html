    <h1>OnlineChess Outage Postmortem</h1>

    <p>
      All programmers will experience an outage evetually in their lives,<br>
      My first experience of an outage happened to my <b>OnlineChess</b> web-app,
      and in this blog serves as postmortem to learn from that experience.
    </p>

    <div class="card">
      <u>Duration of the outage:</u>
      <span>approximately one hour.</span>
      <br><br>
      <u>Magnitude as a result:</u>
      <span>the whole app was down, because of SPOF.</span>
      <br><br>
      <u>Cause of the issue:</u>
      <span>code base crash.</span>
    </div>

    <p>
      Now that formalities are out of the way, let's dive to the meat of it, shall we?
    </p>

    <h3>Timeline:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><u>9:30</u> - an email reached me from the Watchdog alert, informing me of the incident.</li>
      <li><u>9:35</u> - i started investigating the logs in hopes of identifying the erro.</li>
      <li><u>9:45</u> - i had come to the conclusion that cause might be a bug from the latest deployment.</li>
      <li><u>10:30</u> - after more investigation, the root cause was identified (the bug was trying to read attributes of a possibly null value)</li>
      <li><u>11:05</u> - with quick fix everything was operating as expected again.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Identifying the error took longer than expected because it was a problem with the logic itself, after i found out exactly where the problamatic code resides, the fix was as easy as adding an if guard, that's all it took fortunately.<br>
      I admit that not testing the code thouroughly before deployment, and after this incident i stopped taking unit tests for granted.
